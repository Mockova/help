How to Use Reports
==================

Reports offers a quick glance at each projectâ€™s overall stats and
a chronological view of your website issues over a period of time.
It's a useful way to gain a better understanding of when problems occur
and how well you deal with them.

This article will show you how to use Reports to learn more about your project.

Navigate Your Issues Timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your Issues Timeline shows when and where issues occurred during a date range.

Here's how to navigate your Issues Timeline:

* To zoom in or zoom out, scroll up and down with your cursor over the timeline.
* Drag from left or right to select the date range you'd like to view.
* Click on individual issues in your timeline to view Issue Details, which show you a detailed log of the problem and its current status.
