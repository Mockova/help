How Testomato works?
====================

Testomato is an easy automated monitoring service that actively monitors your
website without requiring advanced technical knowledge or complicated
maintenance, allowing you to check your website for problems that impact users
directly. This is article will give you a quick overview of how Testomato works.

In order to monitor your website, Testomato downloads and scans your HTML code
similar to other popular web crawlers (like Googlebot). However, we use our own
crawler, the :doc:`Testomotobot </testomatobot/about>`.

Testomato downloads your HTML source code in order to run checks, but it does
not execute any of the JavaScript on your website. This means that while we can
catch errors in your UI just like a common user would, we do not run your
website in a browser and are unable to find problems that may occur across
different browsers.

What Does Testomato Do?
-----------------------

Modern websites require many complex and critical actions to work correctly.
Most of the time everything works great, but even if your website is available,
there may be parts that are slow or broken. And these problems can sometimes
take days, even weeks, to find.

With Testomato, you can discover issues as they happen to minimize the impact of
issues on your users and prevent your business from losing new signups, current
customers, and revenue.

Testomato allows you to set automated checks to monitor your website for
problems that interfere with the normal operation of your business, alerting you
when something goes wrong.


You can set up simple checks in seconds to monitor for:

- Web pages and forms
- Password-protected pages
- Important SEO indicators
- Common error messages
- HTTP status codes
- Missing content or broken forms
- Network & SSL issues
- Uptime monitoring
- Response time


All website monitoring results are organized and stored in easy-to-read reports,
allowing you to identify error patterns and make responsible decisions based on
reliable data.

Team Testomato is always working hard to improve and expand the features we have
available.
