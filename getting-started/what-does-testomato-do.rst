What Does Testomato Do?
=======================

Modern websites require many complex and critical actions to work correctly.
Most of the time everything works great, but even if your website is available,
there may be parts that are slow or broken. And these problems can sometimes
take days, even weeks, to find.

With Testomato, you can discover issues as they happen to minimize the impact of
issues on your users and prevent your business from losing new signups, current
customers, and revenue.

Testomato allows you to set automated checks to monitor your website for
problems that interfere with the normal operation of your business, alerting you
when something goes wrong.


You can set up simple checks in seconds to monitor for:

- Web pages and forms
- Password-protected pages
- Important SEO indicators
- Common error messages
- HTTP status codes
- Missing content or broken forms
- Network & SSL issues
- Uptime monitoring
- Response time


All website monitoring results are organized and stored in easy-to-read reports,
allowing you to identify error patterns and make responsible decisions based on
reliable data.

Team Testomato is always working hard to improve and expand the features we have
available.
