**All Projects** are meant to help you get a basic overview of what's going
on in your projects in a quick way.

When you sign in to Testomato, we want you to be able to know if there are
problems the minute you see your dashboard. That's why boxes will change
color according to the status of each check.

There are only **4 possible colors** for boxes:

1. **Green**: This page passed all checks
2. **Red**: This page failed on some check.
3. **Orange**: This page timed out.
4. **Gray**: This page has not been configured yet, has been *turned off*, or whose results are not available.

By clicking to **Project Name** or **Open** button it's possible to open
:doc:`Project Dashboard </project/dashboard/project-dashboard>`.
