   :align: center

There are only **4 possible colors** for boxes:

1. **Green**: This page passed all checks
2. **Red**: This page failed on some check.
3. **Orange**: This page timed out.
4. **Gray**: This page has not been configured yet, has been *turned off*, or whose results are not available.

According to your `Payment Plan <https://www.testomato.com/pricing>`_ your **Project dashboard**
also displays a green, red, or orange circle icon, which indicates whether your
homepage is up, down, or timing out.
