Create a Pages Group
====================

Groups come in handy when have rules you want to apply to a specific set of
pages, which may be different from your main project pages.

1. Click on the project youâ€™d like to view or select.

2. Click **Create group** at the bottom of the page.

   :align: center

3. Click **Add check** and define your rules for the group and click **Next**.

4. Name your Group and click  Save. name group

   :alt: Add group name
   :align: center

Once your new Group is created, you will be able to add and manage checks the
same way you manage the public and password-protected areas on your project
dashboard.
