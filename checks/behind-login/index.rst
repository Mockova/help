Monitoring behind login
=======================

Testomato can monitor pages behind login (password protected areas of your
website). If you entrust us with your credentials (password + login) we will a
utomatically login before each check is performed. Checks are run in a separate
session that logs you in using credentials you configure in a login form.

Follow these security tips:

.. warning:: We have to store your credential (password + login) unencrypted. While we will do everything to ensure your safety, please be extra careful.

Follow these security tips:

* Use a testing account just for Testomato.
* Donâ€™t use the same password you are using for your admin account
* Use a restricted user account, not an amin account.
* Use a strong, long password and change password once in a while.

* Do not hesitate to contact us (support@testomato.com) if you notice any suspicious behavior.
