Delay Notifications
===================

To avoid false notifications about website issues in projects, you can set
a delay period before a notification is sent to you.

For example, setting a delay period of 10 minutes means that if we find an
issue at 2:45PM, we will wait until 2:55PM to send you an email alert.
