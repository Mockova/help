Instant Notifications
=====================

Notifications are an easy way to stay informed about your project websites
without having to log in. Testomato sends email notifications about broken
links or elements in your page content. We also alert you once your problem
has been resolved or fixed.

Chose *Instant Notifications Settings* from account menu in top right corner:
