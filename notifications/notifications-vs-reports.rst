Email Notifications vs Email Reports
====================================

What's the Difference Between Email Reports and Notifications? You have the
option to sign up for notifications for your test results as well as
daily, weekly, bi-monthly, and monthly reports, which are both sent
as emails. This article will explain the difference between these
two types of reports.

Notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notifications are sent about the following:

* Broken links or elements in your page content (i.e. when a test fails in your project).
* A problem has been fixed.
* A problem has been resolved.

It is also possible to set up a :doc:`delay period </notifications/delay-notifications>`
to avoid receiving notifications about false or short issues.

Reports
~~~~~~~

Reports are sent about the following:

* Total number of issues that occurred in a project.
* The type of issues and how often they occurred.
* The minimum, median, and maximum length of issues.

Reports can be sent once a day, once a week, twice a month, once a month, or
never. To schedule your reports, please visit :doc:`Profile Settings </account/profile-settings>` in your account menu.
