Project Dashboards
------------------

Project dashboards are meant to help you get a basic overview of what's going
on in your projects in a quick way.

When you sign in to Testomato, we want you to be able to know if there are
problems the minute you see your dashboard. That's why boxes will change
color according to the status of each check.

Here is a project dashboard:

   :align: center

There are only **4 possible colors** for boxes:

1. **Green**: This page passed all checks
2. **Red**: This page failed on some check.
3. **Orange**: This page timed out.
4. **Gray**: This page has not been configured yet, has been *turned off*, or whose results are not available.

According to your `Payment Plan <https://www.testomato.com/pricing>`_ your **Project dashboard**
also displays a green, red, or orange circle icon, which indicates whether your
homepage is up, down, or timing out.

Most important controls on **Project dashboard** are in top-right corner:

* **Share Project** - Add and manage different project roles.
