Testomato Project
=================

What's a Testomato Project? Each individual website or website application URL
that is added to your `Testomato <https://www.testomato.com>`_ account is saved
as a project with its own separate dashboard. Projects contain
:doc:`pre-configured pages and checks </checks/pre-configured-pages>`
(automatically generated by `Testomato <https://www.testomato.com>`_) as well
as any custom created checks you create.

Projects will also be displayed on your main dashboard
(`All Projects <https://www.testomato.com>`_).
To view a :doc:`project dashboard </projects/project-dashboard>`, simply click
on the project's name:
